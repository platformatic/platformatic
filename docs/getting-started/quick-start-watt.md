# Watt Quick Start

Welcome to your first steps with Platformatic Watt, the Node.js Application Server.
This guide will help you set up and run an application composed of the following stack:

- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) frontend, to render our frontend
- Generic `node:http` [`createServer`](https://nodejs.org/docs/latest/api/http.html#httpcreateserveroptions-requestlistener),
  to showcase how to add an existing Node.js app
- [Platformatic Composer](/docs/reference/composer/introduction), to coordinate/expose them all.

:::note

In this guide, we will use `Next.js` as our frontend framework, but you can also use [Astro](https://astro.build/),
or [Remix](https://remix.run/). We plan to expand the list of supported frameworks in the future.

:::


## Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure you have the following installed:
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v20.16.0+ or v22.3.0+)
- [npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/) (v10 or higher)
- A code editor, (e.g., [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/))

## Set up Watt

```bash
mkdir my-app
cd my-app
npx wattpm@latest init
```

Which will output:

```
Need to install the following packages:
wattpm@2.0.0
Ok to proceed? (y) y

[15:48:14.722] DONE (40803): Created a wattpm application in /Users/matteo/tmp/my-app.
```

Then, run `npm install` to install all the dependencies.

## Add your first Node.js application to Watt

Inside `my-app`, create a new directory and add a simple Node.js app:

```bash
mkdir web/node
```

Then add a `package.json` like the following:

```json
{
  "main": "server.js",
  "type": "module",
  "dependencies": {
    "@platformatic/node": "^2.0.0"
  }
}
```

Then, create a `web/node/server.js` file with the following content:

```js
import { createServer } from 'node:http';

export function build () {
  let count = 0

  const server = createServer((req, res) => {
    console.log('received request', req.url)
    res.setHeader('Content-Type', 'application/json');
    res.end(JSON.stringify({ content: `from node:http createServer: ${count++}!` }));
  })

  return server
}
```

:::note

In this example, we are using the built-in `node:http` module to
create a simple HTTP server that responds with a JSON object containing a counter.
You can see that we are returning a `build` function that creates the server.
This server will be run by Watt when the application starts in its
own worker thread.

You can also use [Express](https://expressjs.com/), [Fastify](https://fastify.dev), [Koa](https://koajs.com/)
or any other Node.js framework.

:::


Then, we need to add the `watt.json` config file by running:

```bash
wattpm import web/node
```

Let's install the dependencies in the root of the project with 


```bash
npm install
```

### Start your Watt server

Run the following command in your project directory to start your Watt server:

```bash
npm start
```

This will internally run `wattpm start` and start your Watt server.

If you want to have have a "watch mode" to automatically restart the server when you make changes, you can run:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Which will run `wattpm dev` and start your Watt server in watch mode.

Your first Watt server is now live! ðŸŒŸ You can test it with:

```bash
curl http://localhost:3042
```

## Add a Platformatic Composer to run multiple apps

Inside `my-app`, let's create a new Platformatic Composer

```bash
npx create-platformatic
```

This will output:

```
Need to install the following packages:
create-platformatic@2.0.0
Ok to proceed? (y) y

```

Start your Watt server again:

```bash
npm start
```

Then, you can test it with:

```bash
curl http://localhost:3042/node
```

:::note

You can customize how the various services are expsed by changing `web/composer/platformatic.json`.
Here is the equivalent of the default configuration when exposing a Node.js application: 

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://schemas.platformatic.dev/@platformatic/composer/2.0.0.json",
  "composer": {
    "services": [{
      "id": "node",
      "proxy": {
        "prefix": "/node"
      }
    }],
    "refreshTimeout": 1000
  },
  "watch": true
}
```

:::


## Add a Next.js application to Watt

Inside `my-app`, let's create a new Next.js app:

```bash
npx create-next-app@latest web/next
```

Which will output:

```
âœ” Would you like to use TypeScript? â€¦ No
âœ” Would you like to use ESLint? â€¦ No
âœ” Would you like to use Tailwind CSS? â€¦ No
âœ” Would you like to use `src/` directory? â€¦ Yes
âœ” Would you like to use App Router? (recommended) â€¦ Yes
âœ” Would you like to customize the default import alias (@/*)? â€¦ No
Creating a new Next.js app in /Users/matteo/tmp/my-app/web/next.

- next


added 18 packages in 4s

195 packages are looking for funding
  run `npm fund` for details
Success! Created next at /Users/matteo/tmp/my-app/web/next
```

Then, let's import it to our watt server:

```bash
wattpm import web/next
```

We should also install the additional dependencies with:

```bash
npm i
```

Then, we need to tell Watt to expose our `next` server on `/next` by modifying `web/next/watt.json`:

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://schemas.platformatic.dev/@platformatic/next/2.0.0.json",
  "application": {
    "basePath": "/next"
  }
}
```

You can run `npm run dev` to start your Watt server in dev/watch mode, which in turn will start Next.js
in development mode.

Then, you can test it by opening your browser at [`http://localhost:3042/next`](http://localhost:3042/next).

:::note

In this example, we are exposing the Next.js app at `/next` and the Node.js app at `/node`.
You can change the paths to suit your needs. Make sure to alter the `basePath` in `web/next/watt.json`
and the `prefix` in `web/composer/platformatic.json` accordingly if you customize it.

:::


## `fetch` the data from the Node.js app in the Next.js app

Replace `web/next/src/app/page.js`, with the following code:

```js
import styles from "./page.module.css";

export default async function Home() {
  const { content } = await (await fetch("http://node.plt.local", { cache: 'no-store' })).json();
  return (
    <div className={styles.page}>
      <main className={styles.main}>
        ${content}
      </main>
    </div>
  );
}
```

This will fetch the data from the Node.js app and display it in the Next.js app.
Note that it uses the `node.plt.local` hostname, which is the _internal_ hostname for the `node` service.
This domain name would not work outside of a Watt or Platformatic environment.

:::note

By default Next.js caches all `fetch()` requests.
The `{ cache: 'no-store' }` option is used to disable caching, so that you can see the counter incrementing.

:::

Launch it with: `npm run dev`.

You can now test it by opening your browser at [`http://localhost:3042/next`](http://localhost:3042/next).

## Build and Production mode

To create a build for production, you can run `wattpm build`, which is exposed as npm script:

```bash
npm run build
```

Which will in turn create a build for Next.js and for the Node.js app (in case that is needed).

To run the server in production mode, you can run:

```bash
npm run start
```

which will call `wattpm start`.

## Debug individual services with Chrome DevTools

You can debug your Watt server with Chrome DevTools by running:

```bash
npm run start -- --inspect
```

This will start an inspector instance in each service, and you can connect to it with Chrome DevTools.
Open `chrome://inspect` in Chrome, and you will see the services listed there.

Then, you can click on `inspect` to open the DevTools for that service.
