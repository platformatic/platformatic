## Review Comments to Address

### 1. Use ESM instead of CommonJS in code examples
**File:** `docs/guides/cache-with-platformatic-watt.md`  
**Reviewer:** mcollina  
**Issue:** Code example uses CommonJS module syntax instead of ESM  
**Location:** Line 61 (routes/products.js section)  
**Action Required:** Update code examples to use ESM (import/export) syntax instead of `module.exports`

### 2. Verify example repository links exist
**File:** `docs/overview/use-cases-and-examples.md`  
**Reviewer:** Copilot  
**Issue:** Links to example repositories that may not exist or be accessible  
**Location:** Line 480 - E-commerce Store example  
**Action Required:** 
- Verify all linked example repositories exist and are accessible
- Consider adding fallback documentation or noting if examples are planned for future releases
- Suggested text: `**Live Example:** _(This example repository is planned for a future release. Stay tuned for updates!)_`

### 3. Verify imported issues.md file exists
**File:** `docs/reference/watt/cli-commands.md`  
**Reviewer:** Copilot  
**Issue:** Import statement references a file that may not exist  
**Location:** Lines 1-2 - `import Issues from '../../getting-started/issues.md';`  
**Action Required:** Verify that the imported 'issues.md' file exists at the specified path, as this import could cause build failures if the file is missing

### 4. Add time estimates and difficulty indicators
**File:** `docs/overview/getting-started.md`  
**Reviewer:** Copilot (suppressed comment)  
**Issue:** Learning paths lack concrete time estimates and difficulty indicators  
**Location:** Line 157 - Learning paths section  
**Action Required:** Consider adding concrete time estimates and difficulty indicators (e.g., beginner/intermediate/advanced) for each learning path to help users set proper expectations
