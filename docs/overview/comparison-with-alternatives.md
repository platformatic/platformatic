  "application": {
    "main": "app.js"
  }
}
```

#### Migration Path: Express.js → Watt

**Step 1: Wrap existing Express app**

```bash
# Add Watt configuration to existing Express app
npx wattpm create my-app
```

**Step 2: Add Watt features incrementally**

```json
// Add database service alongside Express app
{
  "services": [
    { "path": "./existing-express-api", "id": "api" },
    { "path": "./database", "id": "db" }
  ]
}
```

**Step 3: Leverage auto-generated APIs**

```javascript
// Gradually replace manual endpoints with auto-generated ones
// Old Express route: GET /users
// New auto-generated: GET /api/users (from database schema)
// Express/Fastify/Next.js all integrate seamlessly with Watt
```

- **True independence**: Services must be deployed and versioned separately
- **Regulatory requirements**: Need complete service isolation

**✅ Choose PM2 when:**

- **Simple Node.js clustering**: Need basic process management
- **Existing Node.js apps**: Want to add clustering without architectural changes
- **Resource management**: Need memory/CPU monitoring for Node.js processes

**Example Traditional Setup:**

```yaml
# docker-compose.yml
services:
  user-service:
    image: user-service:latest
    ports: ['3001:3000']
  product-service:
    image: product-service:latest
    ports: ['3002:3000']
  api-gateway:
    image: nginx
    ports: ['80:80']
    depends_on: [user-service, product-service]
```

#### When to Choose Watt over Traditional Microservices

**✅ Choose Watt when:**

- **Single team or coordinated teams**: One Watt instance per team would solve scaling issues
- **Node.js/PHP focused**: All services can run on supported platforms (Python coming soon)
- **Unified deployment**: Services should be deployed together
- **Development speed**: Want faster iteration cycles
- **Simplified operations**: Prefer single deployment unit with built-in service mesh

**Example Watt Setup:**

```json
{
  "services": [
    { "path": "./user-service", "id": "users" },
    { "path": "./product-service", "id": "products" },
    { "path": "./api-gateway", "id": "gateway" }
  ]
}
```

#### Migration Path: Microservices → Watt

**Step 1: Containerize with Watt**

```bash
# Convert each microservice to Watt service
# Keep existing business logic, change orchestration
```

**Step 2: Consolidate communication**

```javascript
// Replace network calls with internal service mesh
// This works with basic fetch() - no special integration needed
// From: http://user-service:3000/users
// To: http://user-service.plt.local/users
```

**Step 3: Unified observability**

```json
// Single configuration for all service monitoring
{
  "telemetry": {
    "serviceName": "my-app",
    "tracing": { "exporter": "jaeger" },
    "metrics": { "exporter": "prometheus" }
  }
}
```

### Watt vs Serverless Platforms

Serverless platforms (AWS Lambda, Vercel Functions, Cloudflare Workers) focus on function-as-a-service deployments. Note that serverless platforms, specifically AWS Lambda, suffer from significant limitations because they run only one request at a time (or a limited number of concurrent requests), along with cold starts, timeouts, and statelessness constraints.

#### Feature Comparison

| Feature                    | Serverless           | Watt                    |
| -------------------------- | -------------------- | ----------------------- |
| **Cold Starts**            | Present (100-1000ms) | None (always warm)      |
| **Scaling**                | Automatic, infinite  | Manual, bounded         |
| **Cost Model**             | Pay-per-execution    | Pay-per-instance        |
| **State Management**       | Stateless only       | In-memory state allowed |
| **Long-running Processes** | Limited (timeouts)   | Full support            |
| **Development Experience** | Function-focused     | Application-focused     |
| **Vendor Lock-in**         | High                 | Low (runs anywhere)     |

#### When to Choose Serverless

**✅ Choose Serverless when:**

- **Event-driven architecture**: Processing events, not serving requests
- **Infrequent usage**: Applications with very sporadic traffic
- **Simple functions**: Individual functions with minimal complexity
- **Note**: Be aware of cold start penalties, timeout limitations, and vendor lock-in

**Example Serverless Use Case:**

```javascript
// AWS Lambda function
export const handler = async event => {
  const result = await processPayment(event.paymentData)
  return { statusCode: 200, body: JSON.stringify(result) }
}
```

#### When to Choose Watt over Serverless

**✅ Choose Watt when:**

- **Consistent traffic**: Predictable load patterns
- **Stateful applications**: Need in-memory caching, sessions
- **Complex applications**: Multi-service orchestration
- **Long-running processes**: Background jobs, real-time features
- **Development productivity**: Want unified local development

#### Cost Comparison Example

**Serverless (AWS Lambda):**

```
Traffic: 1M requests/month, 200ms avg duration
Cost: ~$20/month (execution time + requests)
Cold starts: 10-15% of requests
```

**Watt (Container deployment):**

```
Traffic: 1M requests/month, consistent load
Cost: ~$50/month (always-on instance)
Cold starts: 0%
Performance: Consistent, predictable
```

- May not fit existing polyglot architectures requiring other languages

**2. Service Independence**

- All services deploy together
- Cannot version services independently
- May not suit large, distributed teams

**3. Ecosystem Maturity**

- Newer than established frameworks
- Smaller community and plugin ecosystem
- Documentation and examples still growing

**4. Learning Curve**

- New concepts for traditional developers
- Configuration-driven approach requires adjustment

### Clear "No" Scenarios

**❌ Don't choose Watt when:**

**Polyglot Requirements**

```
Your architecture: Node.js API + Python ML + Java batch processing
Better choice: Traditional microservices with containers
```

**Extreme Scale Requirements**

```
Your needs: Millions of requests/second, global distribution
Better choice: Specialized high-performance frameworks (Rust/Go) + CDN + distributed databases
```

**Organizational Boundaries**

```
Your team: 50+ developers across 10+ independent teams
Better choice: Independent microservices with clear boundaries
Note: One Watt instance per team would solve coordination issues while maintaining team autonomy
```

**Legacy Constraints**

```
Your constraints: Heavy investment in existing Java/.NET services
Better choice: Gradual modernization within existing stack
```

**Specialized Performance Needs**

```
Your requirements: Sub-millisecond latency, custom protocols
Better choice: Specialized frameworks or languages (Rust, Go, C++)
```

## Summary

Watt excels as a **modular monolith** solution for Node.js teams who want:

- **Unified development experience** across multiple services
- **Auto-generated APIs** from database schemas
- **Built-in observability** without complex setup
- **Simplified deployment** while maintaining service boundaries

Choose alternatives when you need true service independence, polyglot architectures, or have specific constraints that Watt doesn't address.

The best architecture is the one that fits your team, requirements, and constraints. Watt provides a powerful option for teams ready to embrace a new approach to Node.js application development.
