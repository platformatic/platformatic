services:
  user-service:
    image: user-service:latest
    ports: ["3001:3000"]
  product-service:
    image: product-service:latest  
    ports: ["3002:3000"]
  api-gateway:
    image: nginx
    ports: ["80:80"]
    depends_on: [user-service, product-service]
```

// Replace network calls with internal service mesh
// From: http://user-service:3000/users
// To: http://user-service.plt.local/users
```

**Step 3: Unified observability**
```json
// Single configuration for all service monitoring
{
  "telemetry": {
    "serviceName": "my-app",
    "tracing": { "exporter": "jaeger" },
    "metrics": { "exporter": "prometheus" }
  }

**Example Serverless Use Case:**
```javascript
// AWS Lambda function
export const handler = async (event) => {
  const result = await processPayment(event.paymentData)
  return { statusCode: 200, body: JSON.stringify(result) }
}
```

#### When to Choose Watt over Serverless

**✅ Choose Watt when:**
