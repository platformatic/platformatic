## mcollina's Comments (50 items) - NEED ATTENTION

### 🔴 CRITICAL: Factual Errors About Watt

#### what-is-watt.md
1. ❌ "This is not it. Check the actual document."
2. ❌ "Not true. It's 20.3+, but check other docs." (Node.js version requirement)
3. ❌ "This is incorrect. It allows to integrate any existing app."
4. ❌ "See previous paragraph, I don't think this fits."
5. ❌ "This is really not an advantage. Remove it."

#### use-cases-and-examples.md  
6. ❌ **"Watt does not run Databases!"** (CRITICAL misconception)
7. ❌ "The Customer API is not really a database. Put Fastify there"
8. ❌ "Please remove Platformatic DB entirely from this document."
9. ❌ "This is utterly false. Note that this document does not mention workers configuration"

#### comparison-with-alternatives.md
10. ❌ **"We do support PHP, and Python is on the way!"** (Major feature omission)
11. ❌ "This is factually incorrect. Serverless (specifically on AWS Lambda) suffer from significant limitations"
12. ❌ "This is utterly wrong. Next.js performs poorly as an API layer."
13. ❌ "We support the Intelligent Command Center https://platformatichq.com/"

### 🟡 Code Syntax Updates (ESM)

#### cache-with-platformatic-watt.md
14. ❌ Line 61: "use esm"
15. ❌ "use esm" (multiple other instances)
16. ❌ "mention that this is not limited to express."
17. ❌ "The services block is not needed."

#### logging-and-monitoring.md
18. ❌ "use esm" (multiple instances)

### 🟡 Content to Remove (Made-up/Fake Content)

#### use-cases-and-examples.md
19. ❌ "This snippet is completely fake. Must be changed"
20. ❌ "This is totally made up. Validate and fix."
21. ❌ "same."
22. ❌ "Remove all success stories."
23. ❌ "remove all of this. it's totally made up."
24. ❌ "Remove the snippet, do a similar fix"

### 🟡 Structural Changes Needed

#### logging-and-monitoring.md
25. ❌ "The quick start app in Watt uses a basic Node.js core `createServer`. We need a step for setting up Fastify."
26. ❌ "This implies the use of Platformatic Service, Platformatic DB or Platformatic Composer. Specify it."
27. ❌ **"Add a note in the DOCS_RESTRUCTURE_PLAN.md to split this guide into two"**
28. ❌ "There are no monitoring options during setup. You should be using the '@platformatic/node' stackable."
29. ❌ "remove this block about Error Tracking and Sentry"

#### comparison-with-alternatives.md
30. ❌ **"The comparison should be done with PM2 and microservices"** (Major restructure)

#### troubleshooting.md
31. ❌ "You need to split logs, telemetry tracing and metrics into 3 different diagrams"

### 🟡 Technical Corrections

#### health-checks.md
32. ❌ "Check this in the readiness/liveness guide, those are incorrect."
33. ❌ "is this correct?"
34. ❌ "How is this installed?"

#### cli-commands.md
35. ❌ "npx wattpm@latest create" (command correction)

#### use-cases-and-examples.md
36. ❌ "You are missing Platformatic Composer as the entrypoint."
37. ❌ "Change these as well, name Express too."
38. ❌ "This example needs a similar treatment as of the e-commerce one."
39. ❌ "remove this point."
40. ❌ "This is actually a reason to _use_ Watt"
41. ❌ "Add Multithreading here."

#### comparison-with-alternatives.md
42. ❌ "Express or Next or Fastify can all be run in Watt."
43. ❌ "This is not really a problem as it works with basic fetch."
44. ❌ "This is incorrect. One Watt instance per team would solve it."
45. ❌ "npx wattpm create my-app"
46. ❌ "@ShogunPanda can you verify if this actually works?"

#### logging-and-monitoring.md
47. ❌ "You need to customize logging behavior in your Watt application for different environments"
48. ❌ "We need some intermediate step to set up this application correctly."
