- Understanding of Watt's service orchestration
- Production-ready configuration patterns

[**Start the Tutorial ‚Üí**](/docs/learn/beginner/crud-application)

---

### üîç Example-Driven (15-20 minutes)
**Best for:** Developers who learn best from complete, working examples

**What you'll explore:**
- Multiple real-world application patterns
- Copy-paste ready code for common use cases
- Architecture patterns for different project types

[**Browse Examples ‚Üí**](/docs/overview/use-cases-and-examples)

---

### üîÑ Migration-Focused (45-60 minutes)
**Best for:** Teams with existing Node.js applications who want to evaluate Watt

**What you'll accomplish:**
- Assessment framework for migration feasibility
- Step-by-step migration of an existing app
- Side-by-side comparison of before/after complexity

[**Start Migration Guide ‚Üí**](/docs/getting-started/port-your-app)

## Understanding Your Application Type

### Full-Stack Web Applications
**Characteristics:** Frontend + API + Database all managed together  
**Best Path:** Start with **Quick Start**, then **Guided Tutorial**  
**Why Watt fits:** Unified deployment, shared configuration, integrated tooling

### API-First Projects
**Characteristics:** Backend services with auto-generated documentation  
**Best Path:** **Quick Start** focusing on database services  
**Why Watt fits:** Auto-generated REST/GraphQL APIs, built-in OpenAPI

### Microservices Architectures  
**Characteristics:** Multiple services that need orchestration  
**Best Path:** **Example-Driven** to see service composition patterns  
**Why Watt fits:** Service mesh in a single process, simplified deployment

### Existing Node.js Applications
**Characteristics:** You have Express, Fastify, Next.js, or other Node.js apps  
**Best Path:** **Migration-Focused** for evaluation and porting  
**Why Watt fits:** Wrapper patterns for easy integration, gradual migration

## First-Time User Experience Flow

### 1. **Initial Assessment** (2 minutes)
- Read [What is Watt?](/docs/overview/what-is-watt) if you haven't already
- Identify your application type and learning preference above
- Check [system requirements](#system-requirements) below

### 2. **Choose Your Path** (immediate)
- Select one of the four paths based on your assessment
- Bookmark the other paths for later exploration
- Set expectations for time investment

### 3. **Complete Your Chosen Path** (5-60 minutes depending on path)
- Follow your selected path completely
- Don't jump between paths initially - complete one fully first
- Take note of concepts that resonate with your use case

### 4. **Next Steps Planning** (5 minutes)
- Review the "Next Step" recommendation for your completed path
- Identify which additional concepts you need for your project
- Choose your next learning activity

## System Requirements

### Required
- **Node.js** 18.0+ or 20.0+ (LTS versions recommended)
- **npm** 9.0+ or **pnpm** 8.0+ (pnpm recommended for performance)
- **Operating System:** Windows, macOS, or Linux

### Optional (for database features)
- **PostgreSQL** 12+ (recommended for production)
- **MySQL** 8.0+ or **MariaDB** 10.3+
- **SQLite** (automatically available, good for development)

### Quick Environment Check
```bash
node --version    # Should be 18.0+ or 20.0+
npm --version     # Should be 9.0+
# or
pnpm --version    # Should be 8.0+
```

## Common First-Time Questions

### "How is Watt different from [Express/Next.js/other framework]?"
Watt is an **application server** that runs multiple services together, rather than replacing your existing framework. Think of it as orchestration layer that can include Express, Next.js, databases, and more in a single deployment.

**Quick comparison:** [Watt vs. Alternatives](/docs/overview/comparison-with-alternatives)

### "Do I need to rewrite my existing applications?"
No. Watt provides wrapper patterns that let you integrate existing Express, Fastify, Next.js, and other Node.js applications with minimal changes.

**Learn more:** [Migration Guide](/docs/getting-started/port-your-app)

### "Is Watt production-ready?"
Yes. Watt is built on Fastify and includes production features like structured logging, metrics, health checks, and Kubernetes integration out of the box.

**See production examples:** [Deployment Guide](/docs/guides/deployment/)

### "What if I only need [database APIs/frontend hosting/etc.]?"
Watt is modular - you can use just the pieces you need. Each service type (database, HTTP, composer) can be used independently or together.

**Explore service types:** [Architecture Overview](/docs/overview/architecture-overview)
