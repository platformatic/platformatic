# What's Next? Take Your Watt Application Further

Congratulations! You've successfully built your first Watt application and experienced the power of unified API development. 

## What You've Accomplished

In just a few minutes, you've:

✅ **Set up a complete development environment** - Watt automatically handled service discovery, logging, and hot reloading  
✅ **Built working API endpoints** - Both GET and POST endpoints that handle real data  
✅ **Experienced modern development workflow** - ES modules, unified logging, and zero-config auto-restart  
✅ **Created a production-ready foundation** - Your `web/` folder structure is ready to scale  

Your current application demonstrates Watt's core value: **write standard Fastify code, get enterprise-grade development experience automatically**.

## Your Application is Ready to Grow

The foundation you've built is production-ready and can be extended in multiple directions:

- **`watt.json`** - Your application configuration that orchestrates all services
- **`web/` folder** - Contains your API service, ready for more routes and business logic
- **Unified logging** - Already set up across your entire application
- **Hot reloading** - Your development workflow scales as you add more services

## Choose Your Path Forward

Based on what you want to build next, here are your recommended next steps:

### 🎯 **Building API-First Applications**
*Perfect if you're creating backends, microservices, or data-driven applications*

**Next:** **[Build Your First Todo API with Watt](/docs/learn/beginner/crud-application.md)**
- Add a database service that auto-generates REST and GraphQL APIs
- Experience Watt's service orchestration with multiple services
- See unified logging and monitoring across your entire application stack
- Deploy a complete application with a single command

**Why this path:** Experience Watt's killer feature - automatic API generation from database schemas, plus service orchestration.

### 🌐 **Full-Stack Web Applications**
*Choose this if you're building user-facing web applications*

**Next:** Explore **[Frontend Stackables](/docs/reference/next/overview.md)**
- Integrate **Next.js**, **Astro**, **Remix**, or **Vite** with your existing API
- Deploy frontend and backend as a unified application  
- Share configuration and logging between services

**Why this path:** Build complete web applications where frontend and backend deploy together, with shared configuration and unified development experience.

### 🔄 **Migrating Existing Applications** 
*Perfect if you have existing Node.js applications to modernize*

**Next:** **[Port Your Existing App](/docs/getting-started/port-your-app.md)**
- Migrate Express, Fastify, or other Node.js applications to Watt
- Add auto-generated APIs to existing applications
- Modernize deployment and observability

**Why this path:** Keep your existing code while gaining Watt's benefits: unified logging, service orchestration, and modern deployment.

### 🏗️ **Complex Multi-Service Applications**
*Choose this for microservices, enterprise applications, or complex architectures*

**Next:** **[Build Modular Monoliths](/docs/guides/build-modular-monolith.md)**
- Structure multiple services within a single Watt application
- Service-to-service communication without network overhead
- Deploy multiple services as a coordinated unit

**Why this path:** Get microservices benefits without operational complexity - multiple services, single deployment, unified monitoring.

## Immediate Actions You Can Take

While you decide on your path, here are quick experiments you can try right now:

### Add More Routes to Your Current API
```javascript
// Add to your web/index.js
app.get('/api/status', async () => {
  return {
    status: 'healthy',
    uptime: process.uptime(),
    timestamp: new Date().toISOString()
  }
})

app.get('/api/echo/:message', async (request) => {
  return {
    echo: request.params.message,
    headers: request.headers,
    timestamp: new Date().toISOString()
  }
})
```

### Explore Your Application Structure
```bash
# See what Watt generated for you
tree my-app

# Check your application configuration  
cat my-app/watt.json

# View your service configuration
cat my-app/web/package.json
```

### Try Different HTTP Methods
```bash
# Test a DELETE endpoint (add this route first)
curl -X DELETE http://localhost:3042/hello/test-item

# Test with custom headers
curl -H "X-Custom-Header: testing" http://localhost:3042/hello
```

## Understanding Watt's Development Philosophy

What you've experienced represents Watt's core principle: **progressive enhancement of the Node.js development experience**.

- **Start Simple**: Write standard Fastify code in a single file
- **Scale Gradually**: Add databases, frontends, and services as needed
- **Stay Unified**: One configuration, one deployment, one logging system
- **Keep Standard**: No vendor lock-in - it's still JavaScript/TypeScript and Fastify

Your current application already has enterprise-grade features like structured logging, health checks, and production-ready configuration - but they're invisible until you need them.

## Ready for Production?

Your current API is already production-ready! Check out these deployment options:

- **[Dockerize Your App](/docs/guides/deployment/dockerize-a-watt-app.md)** - Container-based deployment
- **[Environment Configuration](/docs/learn/beginner/environment-variables.md)** - Managing different environments
- **[Monitoring & Observability](/docs/guides/monitoring-and-observability.md)** - Production monitoring setup

## Get Help and Stay Connected

- **Documentation**: [Complete Watt Reference](/docs/reference/watt/overview.md)
- **Examples**: [Use Cases and Real-World Examples](/docs/overview/use-cases-and-examples.md)
- **Troubleshooting**: [Common Issues and Solutions](/docs/reference/troubleshooting.md)

## Summary

You've built a working API and experienced Watt's unified development environment. Your application is ready to grow in any direction:

- **Add databases** for data-driven applications
- **Add frontends** for full-stack web applications  
- **Add services** for microservice architectures
- **Deploy to production** with enterprise-grade features built-in

The beauty of Watt is that whichever path you choose, you'll keep the same unified development experience: one configuration file, one command to start everything, one place to see all logs.

**Your next step:** Choose one of the paths above and continue building something amazing with Watt!
