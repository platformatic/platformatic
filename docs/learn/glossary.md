# Platformatic Glossary

## A

**Authorization**
- The process of verifying what a user is allowed to do. Platformatic integrates with various authorization mechanisms to secure APIs.

## B

**Backend**
- The server-side part of a web application responsible for business logic, database interactions, and API management. Platformatic helps streamline backend development.

## C

**CLI (Command Line Interface)**
- A tool for interacting with Platformatic via text commands. The [Platformatic CLI](../packages/platformatic/cli.md) simplifies managing services and configurations.

**CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete)**
- Basic operations for managing data. Platformatic automates CRUD operations for API endpoints based on schemas.

## D

**Database**
- A structured set of data held in a computer. Platformatic supports various databases to store and manage application data.

**Deployment**
- The process of releasing and managing applications in a production environment. Platformatic provides tools for deploying microservices efficiently.

## E

**Entity**
- A representation of a table or data model in Platformatic. Entities are defined using schemas and used to generate API endpoints.

## F

**Framework**
- A platform for developing software applications. Platformatic is a framework designed for building and managing APIs and microservices.

**Fastify**
- A modular Node.js framework

## G

**GUI (Graphical User Interface)**
- A visual way to interact with a computer or software. While Platformatic primarily uses CLI, it may integrate with GUI tools for ease of use.

## H

**HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol)**
- The foundation of data communication on the web. Platformatic uses HTTP protocols to handle API requests and responses.

## I

**Interactive Demos**
- Live demonstrations of Platformatic features that allow users to interact with the software directly in their browsers.

## J

**JSON (JavaScript Object Notation)**
- A lightweight data interchange format. Platformatic uses JSON for configuration files and API communication.

## K

**Kebab-case**
- A naming convention where words are lowercase and separated by hyphens. Used for naming files and endpoints in Platformatic.

## L

**Load Balancing**
- Distributing incoming network traffic across multiple servers. Platformatic supports load balancing to ensure high availability and reliability.

## M

**Microservices**
- An architectural style that structures an application as a collection of loosely coupled services. Platformatic is designed to manage microservices effectively.

## N

**Node.js**
- A JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 engine. Platformatic requires Node.js for running its services and applications.

## O

**OAuth**
- An open standard for access delegation. Platformatic can integrate with OAuth for secure authorization.

## P

**Plugin**
- An add-on that extends the functionality of Platformatic. Plugins can be used to add features like authentication, logging, and are based on [Fastify](https://fastify.dev/docs/latest/Reference/Plugins).

## Q

**Quick Start Guide**
- A beginner-friendly tutorial to help new users get started with Platformatic quickly. Refer to the [Quick Start Guide](../getting-started/quick-start-guide.md) for more information.

## R

**REST (Representational State Transfer)**
- An architectural style for designing networked applications. Platformatic uses REST principles for its API design.

**RPC (Remote Procedure Call)**
- A protocol that allows a program to execute a procedure on a remote server. Platformatic can implement RPC for service communication.

## S

**Schema**
- A structure that defines the format and properties of data. In Platformatic, schemas are used to define entities and generate API endpoints.

**Service**
- A dedicated infrastructure layer for managing service-to-service communication. Platformatic can integrate with service meshes for advanced microservice management.
- A Platformatic [Service](../packages/service/overview.md) is an HTTP server based on [Fastify](https://fastify.dev) that allows developers to build robust APIs with Node.js.

## T

**Todo API Tutorial**
- A beginner-friendly tutorial for creating a simple Todo API using Platformatic. Check out the [Todo API Tutorial](../learn/beginner/crud-application.md) for hands-on learning.

## U

**UUID (Universally Unique Identifier)**
- A 128-bit label used for unique identification. Platformatic uses UUIDs for identifying entities.

## V

**Verdaccio**
- A lightweight private [npm proxy registry](https://verdaccio.org). Recommended for local development with Platformatic.

## W

**WebSocket**
- A protocol providing full-duplex communication channels over a single TCP connection. Platformatic can use WebSockets for real-time communication.

## X

**XML (eXtensible Markup Language)**
- A markup language for encoding documents. Platformatic primarily uses JSON but can also work with XML if needed.

## Y

**YAML (YAML Ain't Markup Language)**
- A human-readable data serialization standard. Used in Platformatic for configuration files alongside JSON.

## Z
