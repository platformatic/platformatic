# Use Stackables to build Platformatic applications

[Platformatic Service](/docs/reference/db/introduction.md) and [Platformatic DB](/docs/reference/db/introduction.md)
offer a good starting point to create new applications. However, most developers or organizations might want to
create reusable services or applications built on top of Platformatic.
We call these reusable services "Stackables" because you can create an application by stacking services on top of them.

This is useful to publish the application on the public npm registry (or a private one!), including building your own CLI,
or to create a specialized template for your organization to allow for centralized bugfixes and updates.

This process is the same one we use to maintain Platformatic DB and Platformatic Composer on top of Platformatic Service.

## Creating a custom Service

We are creating the stackable `foo.js` as follows: 

```js
const { schema, platformaticService } = require('@platformatic/service')

/**  @type {import('fastify').FastifyPluginAsync<{}>} */
async function foo (app, opts) {
  const text = app.platformatic.config.foo.text
  app.get('/foo', async (request, reply) => {
    return text
  })

  await app.register(platformaticService, opts)

  app.get('/', async (request, reply) => {
    return 'Your new root endpoint'
  })
}

foo.configType = 'foo'

// break Fastify encapsulation
foo[Symbol.for('skip-override')] = true

// The schema for our configuration file
foo.schema = {
  $id: 'https://example.com/schemas/foo.json',
  title: 'Foo Service',
  type: 'object',
  properties: {
    server: schema.server,
    plugins: schema.plugins,
    metrics: schema.metrics,
    watch: {
      anyOf: [schema.watch, {
        type: 'boolean'
      }, {
        type: 'string'
      }]
    },
    $schema: {
      type: 'string'
    },
    extends: {
      type: 'string'
    },
    foo: {
      type: 'object',
      properties: {
        text: {
          type: 'string'
        }
      },
      required: ['text']
    }
  },
  additionalProperties: false,
  required: ['server']
}

// The configuration for the ConfigManager
foo.configManagerConfig = {
  schema: foo.schema,
  envWhitelist: ['PORT', 'HOSTNAME'],
  allowToWatch: ['.env'],
  schemaOptions: {
    useDefaults: true,
    coerceTypes: true,
    allErrors: true,
    strict: false
  }
}

module.exports = foo
```

Note that the `$id` property of the schema identifies the module in our system,
allowing us to retrieve the schema correctly.
It is recommended, but not required, that the JSON schema is actually
published in this location. Doing so allows tooling such as the VSCode
language server to provide autocompletion.

In this example, the `schema` adds a custom top-level `foo` property
that users can use to configure this specific module.

ESM is also supported.

## Consuming a custom application

Consuming `foo.js` is simple. We can create a `platformatic.json` file as follows:

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://example.com/schemas/foo.json",
  "extends": "./foo",
  "server": {
    "port": 0,
    "hostname": "127.0.0.1"
  },
  "foo": {
    "text": "Hello World"
  }
}
```

Note that we __must__ specify both the `$schema` property and `extends`.
The module specified with `extends` can also be any modules published on npm and installed via your package manager.

:::note
`extends` is the name of the module we are actually "stacking" (extending) on top of. 
The property `module` can also be used, but it is deprecated. In both cases, be sure that the property is allowed in the stackable schema (in this example in `foo.schema`)
:::

## Building your own CLI
If you want to create your own CLI for your service on top of a Stackable you can just importing the base module and then start it, e.g.:

```js
import base from 'mybasemodule' // Import here your base module
import { start } from '@platformatic/service'
import { printAndExitLoadConfigError } from '@platformatic/config'

await start(base, process.argv.splice(2)).catch(printAndExitLoadConfigError)
```

This is the same as running with platformatic CLI, the `platformatic.json` file will be loaded from the current directory.
