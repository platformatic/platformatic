# Caching

When using Platformatic Refix, you can easily cache your pages and actions.

First of all, make sure you use a [composer](../../composer/overview.md) as the entrypoint of the application.

Then, enable `httpCache` in the [application configuration](../../runtime/configuration.md#httpcache) file.

Finally, make sure your pages return a proper `Cache-Control` header.
See the [Astro documentation](https://remix.run/docs/en/main/route/headers) to learn more.

You are all set!
