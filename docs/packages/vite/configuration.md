# Configuration

Platformatic Vite is configured with a configuration file. It supports the use
of environment variables as setting values with [configuration placeholders](#configuration-placeholders).

## `application`

Supported object properties:

- **`basePath`**: Service proxy base path when exposing this application in a [composer](../../composer/configuration.md) when setting the `proxy` property. If not specified, the service will be exposed on the `/$ID` (where `$ID` is the service ID) id or a value specified in the service code via `platformatic.setBasePath()`.
- **`outputDirectory`**: The subdirectory where production build is stored at when using `wattpm build` or `plt build`. The default is `dist`.
- **`include`**: The paths to include when deploying the service. The default is `['dist']`.
- **`commands`**: An object specifying the commands to manage the application instead of using the Vite defaults. Supported commands are:
  - **`install`**: The command to execute to install the service dependencies. The default is `npm ci --omit-dev`.
  - **`build`**: The command to execute to build the application.
  - **`development`**: The command to execute to start the application in development mode.
  - **`production`**: The command to execute to start the application in production mode.

## `vite`

- **`configFile`**: The configuration file path or `false` to disable autodetection.
- **`devServer.strict`**: Restrict serving files outside of workspace root. By default is `false`.
- **`ssr`**: Configures the application as SSR. Supported object properties:
  - **`enabled`**: If the application is a SSR application.
  - **`entrypoint`**: The application entrypoint file. The default is `server.js`.
  - **`clientDirectory`**: The directory containing client files. The default is `client`.
  - **`serverDirectory`**: The directory containing server files. The default is `server`.
