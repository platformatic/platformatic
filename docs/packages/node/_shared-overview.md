## API

During service execution some APIs are made available in the `globalThis.platformatic` object.

- **`globalThis.platformatic.setBasePath(path)`**: This function can be use to override the base path for the service. If not properly configure in the composer, this can make your application unaccessible.
- **`globalThis.platformatic.serviceId`**: The id of the service.
- **`globalThis.platformatic.workerId`**: The id of the service worker.
- **`globalThis.platformatic.root`**: The root directory of the service.
- **`globalThis.platformatic.basePath`**: The base path of the service in the composer.
- **`globalThis.platformatic.logLevel`**: The log level configured for the service.
- **`globalThis.platformatic.events.on('close')`**: This event is emitted when the process is being closed. A listener should be installed to perform a graceful close, which must finish in 10 seconds. If there is no listener, the process will be terminated by invoking `process.exit(0)`.
- **`globalThis.platformatic.setCustomHealthCheck(fn)`**: This function can be use to set a custom healthcheck function for the service.

## Custom Metrics

Custom metrics can be registered and exported by accessing the same Prometheus registry that the rest of the Platformatic runtime is using via `globalThis.platformatic.prometheus.registry`.

In order to ensure the maximum compatibility the client package (`prom-client`) is available in `globalThis.platformatic.prometheus.client`.

Here it is an example of how to register a custom metric:

```js
const { client, registry } = globalThis.platformatic.prometheus

// Register the metric
const customMetrics = new client.Counter({ name: 'custom', help: 'Custom Description', registers: [registry] })

// ...

// Later increase the value
customMetrics.inc(123)
```

:::note
Remember that it is a good practice to register metrics as soon as possible during the boot phase.

### Typings for the API

In order to get full Typescript support for the API above, you can install the `@platformatic/globals` package and get an alternative, typed, access to the `globalThis.platformatic` object.

The usage of the package is straight-forward:

```js
import { getGlobal } from '@platformatic/globals`

const pltApi = getGlobal()
```

### Custom Healthcheck

Custom health check can be defined to provide more specific and detailed information about the health of your service, in case the default healthcheck for the service itself is not enough and you need to add more checks for the service dependencies.  
This can be done by using the `setCustomHealthCheck` method available on the `globalThis.platformatic` object, and run it as a platformatic service.

Here is an example of how to set a custom health check:

`app.js`

```js
import fastify from 'fastify'

export function create () {
  const app = fastify()

  globalThis.platformatic.setCustomHealthCheck(async () => {
    return Promise.all([
      // Check if the database is reachable
      app.db.query('SELECT 1'),
      // Check if the external service is reachable
      fetch('https://payment-service.com/status')
    ])
  })

  app.get('/', (req, res) => {
    res.send('Hello')
  })

  return app
}
```
