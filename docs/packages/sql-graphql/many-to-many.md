# Many To Many Relationship

Many-to-Many relationships allow you to relate each row in one table to many rows in another table and vice versa.

These relationships are implemented in SQL via a "join table," a table whose **primary key** is composed of the identifiers of the two parts of the many-to-many relationship.

Platformatic DB fully supports many-to-many relationships on all supported databases.

**Schema**

Consider the following schema (SQLite):

```SQL
CREATE TABLE pages (
  id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
  the_title VARCHAR(42)
);

CREATE TABLE users (
  id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
  username VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL
);

CREATE TABLE editors (
  page_id INTEGER NOT NULL,
  user_id INTEGER NOT NULL,
  role VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
  CONSTRAINT fk_editor_pages FOREIGN KEY (page_id) REFERENCES pages(id),
  CONSTRAINT fk_editor_users FOREIGN KEY (user_id) REFERENCES users(id),
  PRIMARY KEY (page_id, user_id)
);
```

In this schema:

- The `pages` table represents the pages.
- The `users` table represents the users.
- The `editors` table is the join table that links `pages` and `users` and includes an additional `role` field.

## Querying Many-to-Many Relationships

Given this schema, you can issue queries to fetch data from the editors table and related `users` and `pages`.

The table `editors` is a "join table" between users and pages.
Given this schema, you could issue queries like:

```graphql
query {
  editors(orderBy: { field: role, direction: DESC }) {
    user {
      id
      username
    }
    page {
      id
      theTitle
    }
    role
  }
}
```

Mutation works exactly the same as before:

```graphql
mutation {
  saveEditor(input: { userId: "1", pageId: "1", role: "captain" }) {
    user {
      id
      username
    }
    page {
      id
      theTitle
    }
    role
  }
}
```
