# Configuration

Platformatic Composer can be configured with a [configuration file](#configuration-files) in the different file formats below. The Composer also supports use of environment variables as setting values with [environment variable placeholders](../composer/configuration.md#setting-and-using-env-placeholders). 

## Configuration Files

Platformatic will automatically detect and load configuration files found in the current working directory with the file names listed [here](../file-formats.md#configuration-files).

To specify a configuration file manually, use the [`--config` option](../cli.md#composer) with any `platformatic composer` CLI command. 

## Supported File Formats

For detailed information on supported file formats and extensions, visit our [Supported File Formats and Extensions](../file-formats.md#supported-file-formats) page

## Configuration Settings

Configuration file settings are grouped as follows:  

- **`server`** **(required)**: Configures the [server settings](../service/configuration.md#server)
- **`composer`**: Specific settings for Platformatic Composer, such as service management and API composition.
- **`metrics`**: Monitors and records performance [metrics](../service/configuration.md#metrics).
- **`plugins`**: Manages additional functionality through [plugins](../service/configuration.md#plugins).
- **`telemetry`**: Handles [telemetry data reporting](../service/configuration.md#telemetry).
- **`watch`**: Observes file changes for [dynamic updates](../service/configuration.md#watch).
- **`clients`**: Configures [client-specific](../service/configuration.md#clients) settings. 

Sensitive data within these settings should use [configuration placeholders](#configuration-placeholders) to ensure security.

### Composer

Configure `@platformatic/composer` specific settings such as `services` or `refreshTimeout`:

- **`services`** (`array`, default: `[]`) â€” is an array of objects that defines
the services managed by the composer. Each service object supports the following settings:

  - **`id`** (**required**, `string`) - A unique identifier for the service. Use a Platformatic Runtime service id if the service is executing inside of [Platformatic Runtime context](../runtime/overview.md#platformatic-runtime-context). 
  - **`origin`** (`string`) - A service origin. Skip this option if the service is executing inside of [Platformatic Runtime context](../runtime/overview.md#platformatic-runtime-context). In this case, service `id` will be used instead of origin. 
  - **`openapi`** (`object`) - The configuration file used to compose [OpenAPI](#openapi) specification. 
  - **`graphql`** (`object`) - The configuration for the [GraphQL](#graphql) service. 
  - **`proxy`** (`object` or `false`) - Service proxy configuration. If `false`, the service proxy is disabled.
    - `prefix` (**required**, `string`) - Service proxy prefix. All service routes will be prefixed with this value.

- **`openapi`** (`object`) - See the Platformatic Service [openapi](../service/configuration.md#service) option for more details.
- **`graphql`** (`object`) - Has the Platformatic Service [graphql](../service//configuration.md#service) options, plus 
  
  - **`addEntitiesResolvers`** (`boolean`) - Automatically add related entities on GraphQL types, following the services entities configuration. See [graphql-composer entities](https://github.com/platformatic/graphql-composer#composer-entities) for details. 
  - **`defaultArgsAdapter`** (`function` or `string`) - The default `argsAdapter` function for the entities, for example for the platformatic db mapped entities queries.

  ```js
  graphql: {
    defaultArgsAdapter: (partialResults) => ({ where: { id: { in: partialResults.map(r => r.id) } } })
  }
  ```

  or with the [metaline](https://github.com/platformatic/metaline) syntax, especially in the case of using the [json configuration](/docs/reference/cli.md#start).

  ```json
  "defaultArgsAdapter": "where.id.in.$>#id"
  ```
  - **`onSubgraphError`** (`function`) - Hook called when an error occurs getting schema from a subgraph. The arguments are:
    - `error` (`error`) - The error message
    - `subgraphName` (`string`) - The erroring subgraph

 Its important to note GraphQL subscriptions are not supported in the composer yet.

- **`refreshTimeout`** (`number`) - The number of milliseconds to wait for check for changes in the services. If not specified, the default value is `1000`; set to `0` to disable.

- **`addEmptySchema`** (`boolean`) - If true, the composer will add an empty response schema to the composed OpenAPI specification. Default is `false`.

### OpenAPI

- **`url`** (`string`) - A path of the route that exposes the OpenAPI specification. If a service is a Platformatic Service or Platformatic DB, use `/documentation/json` as a value. Use this or `file` option to specify the OpenAPI specification.
- **`file`** (`string`) - A path to the OpenAPI specification file. Use this or `url` option to specify the OpenAPI specification.
- **`prefix`** (`string`) - A prefix for the OpenAPI specification. All service routes will be prefixed with this value.
- **`config`** (`string`) - A path to the OpenAPI configuration file. This file is used to customize the [OpenAPI](#openapi-configuration)specification. 

### OpenAPI Configuration

The OpenAPI configuration file is a JSON file that is used to customize the OpenAPI specification. It supports the following options:

- **`ignore`** (`boolean`) - If `true`, the route will be ignored by the composer.
If you want to ignore a specific method, use the `ignore` option in the nested method object.

  ```json title="Example JSON object"
  {
    "paths": {
      "/users": {
        "ignore": true
      },
      "/users/{id}": {
        "get": { "ignore": true },
        "put": { "ignore": true }
      }
    }
  }
  ```

- **alias** (`string`) - Use it create an alias for the route path. Original route path will be ignored.


  ```json title="Example JSON object"
  {
    "paths": {
      "/users": {
        "alias": "/customers"
      }
    }
  }
  ```

- **`rename`** (`string`) - Use it to rename composed route response fields.
Use json schema format to describe the response structure, this only for  `200` response. 

  ```json title="Example JSON object"
  {
    "paths": {
      "/users": {
        "responses": {
            "200": {
              "type": "array",
              "items": {
                "type": "object",
                "properties": {
                  "id": { "rename": "user_id" },
                  "name": { "rename": "first_name" }
                }
              }
            }
          }
      }
    }
  }
  ```

  Composition of two remote services:

  ```json title="Example JSON object"
  {
    "composer": {
      "services": [
        {
          "id": "auth-service",
          "origin": "https://auth-service.com",
          "openapi": {
            "url": "/documentation/json",
            "prefix": "auth"
          }
        },
        {
          "id": "payment-service",
          "origin": "https://payment-service.com",
          "openapi": {
            "file": "./schemas/payment-service.json"
          }
        }
      ],
      "refreshTimeout": 1000
    }
  }
  ```

  Composition of two local services inside of Platformatic Runtime:

  ```json title="Example JSON object"
  {
    "composer": {
      "services": [
        {
          "id": "auth-service",
          "openapi": {
            "url": "/documentation/json",
            "prefix": "auth"
          }
        },
        {
          "id": "payment-service",
          "openapi": {
            "file": "./schemas/payment-service.json"
          }
        }
      ],
      "refreshTimeout": 1000
    }
  }
  ```

### GraphQL

- **`host`** (`string`) - service host; if not specified, the `service.origin` is used.
- **`name`** (`string`) - name to identify the service. If not specified, the `service.origin` is used.
- **`graphqlEndpoint`** (`string`) - The graphql endpoint path, the default value is the common `'/graphql'`.
- **`composeEndpoint`** (`string`) - The endpoint to retrieve the introspection query from, default is `'/.well-known/graphql-composition'`. In case the endpoint is not available, a second call with introspection query will be sent to the `graphqlEndpoint`.
- **`entities`** (`object`) - Configuration object for working with entities in this subgraph, the values are objects with the following schema:
  - **`resolver`** (`object`) - The resolver to retrieve a list of objects - should return a list - and should accept as a arguments a list of primary keys or foreign keys.
    - **`name`** (`string`, **required**) - The name of the resolver.
    - **`argsAdapter (partialResults)`** (`function` or `string`) - The function invoked with a subset of the result of the initial query, where `partialResults` is an array of the parent node. It should return an object to be used as argument for `resolver` query. Can be a function or a [metaline](https://github.com/platformatic/metaline) string.
  **Default:** if missing, the `defaultArgsAdapter` function will be used; if that is missing too, a [generic one](lib/utils.js#L3) will be used.
    - **`partialResults`** (`function` or `string`) - The function to adapt the subset of the result to be passed to `argsAdapter` - usually is needed only on resolvers of `fkeys` and `many`. Can be a function or a [metaline](https://github.com/platformatic/metaline) string.
  - **`pkey`** (`string`, **required**) - The primary key field to identify the entity.
  - **`fkeys`** (`array of objects`) an array to describe the foreign keys of the entities, for example `fkeys: [{ type: 'Author', field: 'authorId' }]`.
    - **`type`** (`string`, **required**) - The entity type the foreign key is referred to.
    - **`field`** (`string`) - The foreign key field.
    - **`as`** (`string`) - When using `addEntitiesResolvers`, it defines the name of the foreign entity as a field of the current one, as a single type.
    - **`pkey`** (`string`) - The primary key of the foreign entity.
    - **`subgraph`** (`string`) - The subgraph name of the foreign entity, where the resolver is located; if missing is intended the self.
    - **`resolver`** (object) - The resolver definition to query the foreign entity, same structure as `entity.resolver`.
  - **`many`** (`array of objects`) - Describe a 1-to-many relation - the reverse of the foreign key.
    - **`type`** (`string`, **required**) - The entity type where the entity is a foreign key.
    - **`fkey`** (`string`, **required**) - The foreign key field in the referred entity.
    - **`as`** (`string`, **required**) - When using `addEntitiesResolvers`, it defines the name of the relation as a field of the current one, as a list.
    - **`pkey`** (`string`) - The primary key of the referred entity.
    - **`subgraph`** (`string`) - The subgraph name of the referred entity, where the resolver is located; if missing is intended the self.
    - **`resolver`** (`object`, **required**) - The resolver definition to query the referred entity, same structure as `entity.resolver`.
