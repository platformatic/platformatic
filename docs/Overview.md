# Watt - The Node.js Application Server

**Watt** is Platformatic's flagship Node.js Application Server that transforms how you build, deploy, and scale Node.js applications. Instead of managing multiple applications, databases, and frameworks separately, Watt provides a unified platform where everything runs together seamlessly.

## What is Watt?

Watt is a complete Node.js application server that handles the complex infrastructure so you can focus on building features. Think of it as the runtime that powers your entire backend - from APIs and databases to frontend frameworks and microservices.

**Key Benefits:**

- üöÄ **Unified Development** - Run databases, APIs, and frontend frameworks in a single application server
- ‚ö° **Built-in Observability** - Automatic logging, metrics, and distributed tracing
- üîß **Zero Configuration** - Sensible defaults that work out of the box
- üìä **Auto-Generated APIs** - REST and GraphQL endpoints from your database schema
- üé® **Framework Agnostic** - Works with Next.js, React, Vue, Express, Fastify, and more

## Why Choose Watt?

Modern Node.js development is fragmented. You need separate tools for databases, APIs, frontend frameworks, monitoring, and deployment. Watt unifies all of this into a single, coherent application server.

**Before Watt:**

- Multiple servers to manage (database, API, frontend)
- Complex deployment pipelines
- Fragmented monitoring and logging
- Inconsistent development environments

**With Watt:**

- Single application server runs everything
- One-command deployment
- Unified observability across all components
- Consistent development and production environments

## What You Can Build with Watt

Watt provides a comprehensive set of capabilities:

- **Database APIs** - Auto-generated REST and GraphQL endpoints from SQL databases (Platformatic DB)
- **HTTP Services** - Custom application logic and APIs built on Fastify
- **API Gateways** - Aggregate multiple applications into unified endpoints
- **Framework Integration** - [Next.js, Astro, Remix, Vite, NestJS applications](/docs/guides/frameworks)
- **Microservice Orchestration** - Multi-application deployments as single units
- **Built-in Authorization** - Role-based access control and JWT authentication
- **Real-time Features** - WebSocket and GraphQL subscriptions
- **Production Monitoring** - Prometheus metrics, OpenTelemetry tracing, structured logging

## How Watt Works

Watt acts as the foundation that runs and orchestrates different types of applications within a single Node.js application. Each application type serves a specific purpose while benefiting from shared infrastructure like logging, metrics, and configuration.

### üîç Observability by Default

Every Watt application includes production-ready monitoring:

- **Structured logging** with configurable levels
- **Prometheus metrics** for monitoring
- **OpenTelemetry tracing** for distributed systems
- **Health checks** for Kubernetes deployments
