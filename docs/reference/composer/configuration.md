# Configuration

Platformatic Composer configured with a configuration file. It supports the use
of environment variables as setting values with [environment variable placeholders](#environment-variable-placeholders).

## Configuration file

If the Platformatic CLI finds a file in the current working directory matching
one of these filenames, it will automatically load it:

- `platformatic.composer.json`
- `platformatic.composer.json5`
- `platformatic.composer.yml` or `platformatic.composer.yaml`
- `platformatic.composer.tml` or `platformatic.composer.toml`

Alternatively, a [`--config` option](/reference/cli.md#composer) with a configuration
filepath can be passed to most `platformatic composer` CLI commands.

The configuration examples in this reference use JSON.

### Supported formats

| Format | Extensions |
| :-- | :-- |
| JSON | `.json` |
| JSON5 | `.json5` |
| YAML | `.yml`, `.yaml` |
| TOML | `.tml` |

Comments are supported by the JSON5, YAML and TOML file formats.

## Settings

Configuration settings are organised into the following groups:

- [`server`](#server) **(required)**
- [`composer`](#composer)
- [`metrics`](#metrics)
- [`plugins`](#plugins)
- [`telemetry`](#telemetry)
- [`watch`](#watch)
- [`clients`](#clients)

Sensitive configuration settings containing sensitive data should be set using [configuration placeholders](#configuration-placeholders).

### `server`

See [Platformatic Service server](/docs/reference/service/configuration.md#server) for more details.

### `metrics`

See [Platformatic Service metrics](/docs/reference/service/configuration.md#metrics) for more details.

### `plugins`

See [Platformatic Service plugins](/docs/reference/service/configuration.md#plugins) for more details.

### `composer`

Configure `@platformatic/composer` specific settings such as `services` or `refreshTimeout`:

- **`services`** (`array`, default: `[]`) â€” is an array of objects that defines
the services managed by the composer. Each service object supports the following settings:

  - **`id`** (**required**, `string`) - A unique identifier for the service. Use a Platformatic Runtime service id if the service is executing inside of [Platformatic Runtime context](/docs/reference/runtime/introduction.md#platformatic-runtime-context).
  - **`origin`** (`string`) - A service origin. Skip this option if the service is executing inside of [Platformatic Runtime context](/docs/reference/runtime/introduction.md#platformatic-runtime-context). In this case, service id will be used instead of origin.
  - **`openapi`** (`object`) - The configuration file used to compose OpenAPI specification. See the [openapi](#openapi) for details.
  - **`graphql`** (`object`) - The configuration for the GraphQL service. See the [graphql](#graphql) for details.
  - **`proxy`** (`object` or `false`) - Service proxy configuration. If `false`, the service proxy is disabled.
    - `prefix` (**required**, `string`) - Service proxy prefix. All service routes will be prefixed with this value.

- **`openapi`** (`object`) - See the Platformatic Service [service](/docs/reference/service/configuration.md#service) openapi option for details.
- **`graphql`** (`object`) - Has the Platformatic Service [service](/docs/reference/service/configuration.md#service) graphql options, plus
  
  - **`addEntitiesResolvers`** (`boolean`) - Automatically add related entities on GraphQL types, following the services entities configuration. See [graphql-composer entities](https://github.com/platformatic/graphql-composer#composer-entities) for details. Default is disabled.
  - **`defaultArgsAdapter`** (`function` or `string`) - The default `argsAdapter` function for the entities, for example for the platformatic db mapped entities queries
  ```js
  graphql: {
    defaultArgsAdapter: (partialResults) => ({ where: { id: { in: partialResults.map(r => r.id) } } })
  }
  ```
  or with the [metaline](https://github.com/platformatic/metaline) syntax, especially in the case of using the [json configuration](/docs/reference/cli.md#start)
  ```json
  "defaultArgsAdapter": "where.id.in.$>#id"
  ```
  - **`onSubgraphError`** (`function`) - Hook called when an error occurs getting schema from a subgraph. The arguments are:
    - `error` (`error`) - The error
    - `subgraphName` (`string`) - The erroring subgraph

  GraphQL subscriptions are not supported in the composer yet.

- **`refreshTimeout`** (`number`) - The number of milliseconds to wait for check for changes in the services. If not specified, the default value is `1000`; set to `0` to disable.

#### `openapi`

- **`url`** (`string`) - A path of the route that exposes the OpenAPI specification. If a service is a Platformatic Service or Platformatic DB, use `/documentation/json` as a value. Use this or `file` option to specify the OpenAPI specification.
- **`file`** (`string`) - A path to the OpenAPI specification file. Use this or `url` option to specify the OpenAPI specification.
- **`prefix`** (`string`) - A prefix for the OpenAPI specification. All service routes will be prefixed with this value.
- **`config`** (`string`) - A path to the OpenAPI configuration file. This file is used to customize the OpenAPI specification. See the [openapi-configuration](#openapi-configuration) for details.

##### `openapi-configuration`

The OpenAPI configuration file is a JSON file that is used to customize the OpenAPI specification. It supports the following options:

- **`ignore`** (`boolean`) - If `true`, the route will be ignored by the composer.
If you want to ignore a specific method, use the `ignore` option in the nested method object.

  _Example_

  ```json
  {
    "paths": {
      "/users": {
        "ignore": true
      },
      "/users/{id}": {
        "get": { "ignore": true },
        "put": { "ignore": true }
      }
    }
  }
  ```

- **alias** (`string`) - Use it create an alias for the route path. Original route path will be ignored.

  _Example_

  ```json
  {
    "paths": {
      "/users": {
        "alias": "/customers"
      }
    }
  }
  ```

- **`rename`** (`string`) - Use it to rename composed route response fields.
Use json schema format to describe the response structure. For now it works only for `200` response.

  _Example_

  ```json
  {
    "paths": {
      "/users": {
        "responses": {
            "200": {
              "type": "array",
              "items": {
                "type": "object",
                "properties": {
                  "id": { "rename": "user_id" },
                  "name": { "rename": "first_name" }
                }
              }
            }
          }
      }
    }
  }
  ```

_Examples_

  Composition of two remote services:

  ```json
  {
    "composer": {
      "services": [
        {
          "id": "auth-service",
          "origin": "https://auth-service.com",
          "openapi": {
            "url": "/documentation/json",
            "prefix": "auth"
          }
        },
        {
          "id": "payment-service",
          "origin": "https://payment-service.com",
          "openapi": {
            "file": "./schemas/payment-service.json"
          }
        }
      ],
      "refreshTimeout": 1000
    }
  }
  ```

  Composition of two local services inside of Platformatic Runtime:

  ```json
  {
    "composer": {
      "services": [
        {
          "id": "auth-service",
          "openapi": {
            "url": "/documentation/json",
            "prefix": "auth"
          }
        },
        {
          "id": "payment-service",
          "openapi": {
            "file": "./schemas/payment-service.json"
          }
        }
      ],
      "refreshTimeout": 1000
    }
  }
  ```

It should return an object to be used as argument for `resolver` query. Can be a function or a [metaline](https://github.com/platformatic/metaline) string.
  **Default:** if missing, the `defaultArgsAdapter` function will be used; if that is missing too, a [generic one](lib/utils.js#L3) will be used.
    - **`partialResults`** (`function` or `string`) - The function to adapt the subset of the result to be passed to `argsAdapter` - usually is needed only on resolvers of `fkeys` and `many`. Can be a function or a [metaline](https://github.com/platformatic/metaline) string.
  - **`pkey`** (`string`, **required**) - The primary key field to identify the entity.
