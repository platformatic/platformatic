# Platformatic

## Running and Developing DB

### Introduction 

Welcome to the Platformatic development guide. This document will help you set up your development environment, run the [Platformatic DB](https://docs.platformatic.dev/docs/db/overview), and contribute to the project. Follow the steps below to get started.

### Preparation

1. **Clone the repository**: Clone this repository and navigate to the platformatic directory.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/platformatic/platformatic.git
cd platformatic
```

2. **Install pnpm**: Install pnpm: Follow the official [pnpm installation guide](https://pnpm.io/installation) to install pnpm globally on your machine.

3. **Setup pnpm**: Run the setup script to configure the local path and restart your terminal.

```sh
pnpm setup 
```

4. **Install dependencies**: Install the dependencies for platformatic.

```sh
pnpm install 
```

5. **Install Docker**: Install Docker using [Docker desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop) or [Colima](https://github.com/abiosoft/colima)

6. **Run Docker Compose**: Depending on your system, use the appropriate Docker Compose file to set up your environment.

- On Intel Macs:

```sh 
docker compose -f docker-compose-mac.yml up
```

- On Apple Silicon Macs:

```sh 
docker compose -f docker-compose-apple-silicon.yml up
```

- On Windows:

```sh 
docker-compose up 
```

## Link Platformatic Globally 

To ensure your global installation of `platformatic` resolves to your local copy, add a script in the root project to handle linking. This will allow you to use `platformatic` and `plt` commands globally.

1. **Add global-links Script**
In the `package.json` file of the root project, add the following script:

```json
"scripts": {
  "global-links": "cd packages/cli && pnpm link --global && cd ../create-platformatic && pnpm link --global"
}
```

2. **Run the global-links Script**
From the root folder of the project, run:

```sh
pnpm run global-links
```

You might receive a `pnpm` warning, but everything should be set up correctly. Verify by running:

```sh
platformatic 
```

## Running Platformatic locally 

To create a new Platformatic app using your local version, follow these steps:

1. **Link Platformatic and create-platformatic Globally**:
From the root folder of the project, run:

```sh
pnpm run global-links
```

2. **Create a new directory for your app**:

```sh
mkdir platformatic-app
cd platformatic-app
```

3. **Initialize a new Platformatic app using the create-platformatic** command:

```sh 
npx create-platformatic
```

4. **Follow the prompts** to configure your new app. You'll be asked to provide some information like the project name and template. Choose the options that best suit your needs

5. **Navigate into your newly created app's directory**:

```sh 
cd platformatic-app
```

6. **Run the Platformatic app** to verify everything is set up correctly:

```sh 
platformatic start
```

You should see output indicating that your Platformatic app is running on `http://localhost:3042`

### SQLite module CPU arch incompatibility
If you encounter errors related to the SQLite module CPU architecture, follow these steps:

1. Ensure `pnpm` was not installed with `volta`. If so, reinstall it using another method.
2. Remove the `node_modules` directory and clear the pnpm store.

```sh 
rm -rf ./node_modules
pnpm store prune
pnpm store path
rm -fr /path/from/the/above/command
```
3. Reinstall the dependencies.
   
```sh 
pnpm install
```
**env: node: No such file or directory**
If you encounter this error when using pnpm, try the following:

1. Remove the `pnpm` installation.
```sh 
which pnpm 
```
2. Ensure the correct Node.js version is in use.
3. Reinstall `pnpm` 
```sh 
npm install  -g pnpm 
```

### Starting Platformatic DB 

Refer to the [quick start guide](https://github.com/platformatic/platformatic/blo) for thorough documentation, or follow these steps to quickly create and start a [Platformatic DB](https://docs.platformatic.dev/docs/db/overview) server:

1. **Create Working Directories:**

```sh 
mkdir -p my-demo 
cd my-demo 
```

2. **Initialize a package.json**: Create a package.json file.

```sh 
npm init --yes
```

1. **Create a migrations directory**: Create a directory for your database migration files.

```sh 
mkdir migrations
touch migrations/001.do.sql
```

Add the following SQL query to `001.do.sql`:

```sql 
CREATE TABLE pages (
  id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
  title VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL
)
```

4. **Create Platformatic Configuration File**: Create and configure `platformatic.json`.

```sh 
touch platformatic.db.json
```

Add the following configuration:

```json 
{
  "server": {
    "hostname": "127.0.0.1",
    "port": "3042"
  },
  "db": {
    "connectionString": "sqlite://./pages.db"
  },
  "migrations": {
    "dir": "./migrations",
    "autoApply": true
  }
}
```

5. **Start API Server:** Use the Platformatic CLI to start your API server.

```sh
platformatic start
```

6.**Interact with the API**


### Testing

1. **Run Tests**: Execute tests using pnpm.

```sh 
pnpm test
```

If you encounter issues with failing tests without code changes, try:

1. Clean the environment.

```sh
pnpm cleanall
```

2. Clear `pnpm` store and reinstall packages.

```sh
pnpm store path
rm -rf /path/from/previous/command
pnpm install
```

Please ensure all tests pass before opening a pull request.

### Updating the CLI docs

The `cli.md` file is automatically generated and should not be manually edited. To update the CLI docs:

1. Update or add the text helpers
2. Generate the docs.

```sh 
node scripts/gen-cli-doc.mjs
```

### Releasing

Platformatic modules share the same release number and are released in a single process. Dependencies use `workspace:*` replaced by precise versions during publish by `pnpm`.

1. Update the version in the root `package.json`.

2. Sync the version.

```sh
./scripts/sync-version.sh
```

3. Publish the release.

```sh 
pnpm -r publish --access=public
```

### Creating and Merging a PR

When creating a pull request:

1. If it fixes a GitHub issue, add the following at the top of the PR description:

```sh 
fixes #issue number 
```

2. Ensure all checks pass and the changes are approved.
3. Merge the PR using the "squash and merge" option.

### Navigating the project via ctags

You can navigate the project using [universal ctags](https://github.com/universal-ctags/ctags). Generate a `tags` file with:

```
ctags --exclude=node_modules --exclude='**/*.test.js' --exclude='**/build' -R *
```
