# Platformatic

## Running and Developing DB

### Preparation

1. Clone this repository, and enter in the directory (`cd platformatic` on most installations)
2. Install pnpm `npm i pnpm --location=global` (if you're on Mac, you can use `brew` to install it with `brew install pnpm`)
3. Make sure to run `pnpm setup` to configure the local path; then close and reopen your terminal.
4. Install dependencies `pnpm i`
5. Install docker with Docker Desktop or [Colima](https://github.com/abiosoft/colima)

To have your global install of `platformatic` resolve to your local copy instead of the version installed via npm, you
should use [`pnpm link`](https://pnpm.io/cli/link). This will add links so that you can use the `platformatic` and `plt`
commands everywhere.

Run from the root folder of the project, execute the following.

```sh
cd packages/cli
pnpm link --global
```
This might give you a `pnpm` warning. However, everything should be set up
correctly anyway. You can verify everything works by running `platformatic`.

  <summary><b>Troubleshooting</b></summary>

##### [SQLite module CPU arch incompatibility](https://github.com/platformatic/platformatic/issues/754)
```
Error: Cannot find module '/platformatic/node_modules/.pnpm/sqlite3@5.1.4/node_modules/sqlite3/lib/binding/napi-v6-darwin-unknown-arm64/node_sqlite3.node'
Require stack:
- /platformatic/node_modules/.pnpm/sqlite3@5.1.4/node_modules/sqlite3/lib/sqlite3-binding.js
- /platformatic/node_modules/.pnpm/sqlite3@5.1.4/node_modules/sqlite3/lib/sqlite3.js
- /platformatic/node_modules/.pnpm/@databases+sqlite@4.0.2/node_modules/@databases/sqlite/lib/index.js
- /platformatic/packages/sql-mapper/mapper.js
- /platformatic/packages/db-core/index.js
```

First of all, check that `pnpm` has NOT been installed with `volta`. If so, remove it and install it again with another method.

Remove the `node_modules` folder with `rm -fr ./node_modules`, then delete the pnpm cache with:
```
pnpm store prune

# Get the path of the pnpm store
pnpm store path

# Remove the pnpm store folder
rm -fr /path/from/the/above/command
```

Then install again all of the needed packages by running `pnpm i`.

##### `env: node: No such file or directory` when using `pnpm`
* get the `pnpm` path with `which pnpm`, then remove it; it's best to use the package manager you installed `pnpm` with
* verify that the node version in use [is correct](https://docs.platformatic.dev/docs/getting-started/quick-start-guide/#prerequisites)
* reinstall it (`npm install pnpm -g`)

### Start platformatic db

Read thorough documentation on the [quick start guide](https://github.com/platformatic/platformatic/blob/main/docs/getting-started/quick-start-guide.md), 
<details>
   <summary>or follow these steps to quickly create and start a platformatic db server.</summary>

1. Create directories to work from `mkdir -p my-demo` then `cd my-demo`
2. Then create a package.json file with the default configs: `npm init --yes`
3. Create a migrations directory to store your database migration files: `mkdir migrations`
   Then create a new migration file named 001.do.sql in the migrations directory: `touch migrations/001.do.sql`
   Copy and paste this SQL query into the migration file:
   ```sql
   CREATE TABLE pages (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    title VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL
   )
   ```
4. In your project directory, create a new Platformatic configuration file named platformatic.db.json: `touch platformatic.db.json`
   Copy and paste this configuration:
   ```json
   {
     "server": {
       "hostname": "127.0.0.1",
       "port": "3042"
     },
     "db": {
       "connectionString": "sqlite://./pages.db"
     },
     "migrations": {
       "dir": "./migrations",
       "autoApply": true
     }
   }
   ```
5. In your project directory, use the Platformatic CLI to start your API server: `platformatic db start`
6. Start interacting with the API by opening the following link on your browser http://127.0.0.1:3042/documentation/static/index.html or you can use curl
   to do it. Read the quick start guide to see examples.

### Run dashboard development server

Create a `./packages/db-dashboard/.env` file with the following content
```
VITE_SERVER_URL=http://localhost:3042
```
Or whatever port you are running platformatic DB server on. 

Use the command 
```sh
pnpm run dashboard:start
```

This will start a vite server on port `5173` by default, with watcher and hot-reload (as a standard `vite` application).

Note that GraphiQL will _not_ work because platformatic-db has not been started
yet.

### Run platformatic-db service

First build the dashboard for production with the command
```sh
pnpm run dashboard:build
```

This will create compressed files and assets under **packages/db-dashboard/build** directory.
To run the service:
```sh
platformatic db
```
This will load config from local directory (i.e using config file **platformatic.db.json**).

If you want to use another config file use the option `--config=/path/to/some.json`.

### Testing

1. Start the RDBMS

   We use Docker to start all the databases we develop against.

   On Linux, execute: `docker compose up`

   On Intel Macs: `docker compose -f docker-compose-mac.yml up` 

   On Apple Silicon Macs: `docker compose -f docker-compose-apple-silicon.yml up` 

   On Windows, execute: `docker-compose up --build`
1. Run `pnpm run dashboard:build` 
1. Run tests: `pnpm test`

If you encounter issues running tests (f.e. failing tests without making a change to the codebase), try to:
1. Run `pnpm cleanall`
2. Run `pnpm store path` and remove the folder shown as an output
3. Run `pnpm install` again

__Before opening a pull request, please ensure that the tests are passing for the specific project you are working on.__

### Updating the CLI docs

The [cli.md](./docs/reference/cli.md) file is automatically generated through the [gen-cli-doc.mjs](./scripts/gen-cli-doc.mjs) script and you must not manually change it.

To update the CLI docs:
1. Update/add the txt helpers
2. run `node scripts/gen-cli-doc.mjs`

### Releasing

All platformatic modules share the same release number and are released
in a single process. In order to avoid internal breakages, dependencies as
part of this repository are using the `workspace:*` which will be replaced
by precise versions during publish by pnpm.

The procedure to release is simple:

1. Update the version of the root `package.json`
1. run `./scripts/sync-version.sh`
1. run `pnpm -r publish --access=public`

### Creating and merging a PR 
On the top of the PR description, if this is a fix of a github issue, add:
```
fixes #issuenum 
```
When all checks are passed and the changes are approved, merge the PR with `squash and merge` option

## Navigating the project via ctags

You can navigate the project using [universal ctags](https://github.com/universal-ctags/ctags). To generate a valid `tags` file use the following command:

```
ctags --exclude=node_modules --exclude='**/*.test.js' --exclude='**/build' -R *
```
