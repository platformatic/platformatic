Fetch OpenAPI schemas from remote services to use in your Platformatic project.

``` bash
  $ platformatic composer openapi schemas fetch
```

It will fetch all the schemas from the remote services and store them by path
set in the `platformatic.composer.json` file. If the path is not set, it will
skip fetching the schema.
