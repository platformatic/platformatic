Start the Platformatic Composer server with the following command:

``` bash
 $ platformatic composer start
 ```

You will need a configuration file. Here is an example to get you started,
save the following as `platformatic.composer.json`:

``` json
  {
    "server": {
      "hostname": "127.0.0.1",
      "port": 0,
      "logger": {
        "level": "info"
      }
    },
    "composer": {
      "services": [
        {
          "id": "service1",
          "origin": "http://127.0.0.1:3051",
          "openapi": {
            "url": "/documentation/json"
          }
        },
        {
          "id": "service2",
          "origin": "http://127.0.0.1:3052",
          "openapi": {
            "file": "./schemas/service2.openapi.json"
          }
        }
      ],
      "refreshTimeout": 1000
    }
  }
```

By sending the SIGUSR2 signal, the server can be reloaded.

Options:

* `-c, --config FILE` - Specify a configuration file to use.

If not specified, the configuration will be loaded from any of the following, in the current directory.

* `platformatic.composer.json`, or
* `platformatic.composer.yml`, or 
* `platformatic.composer.tml`

You can find more details about the configuration format here:
