Generate an openapi schema from a typescript fastify application.

To create a client for a remote OpenAPI API, you can use the following command:

```bash
$ npx plt-rpc --ts-config ./tsconfig.json --path ./openapi.json
```

Options:

* `--ts-config <path>` - Path to the typescript configuration file.
* `--path <path>` - Path to the openapi schema file.

Platformatic RPC API is in the experimental stage. The feature is not subject to semantic versioning rules.
Non-backward compatible changes or removal may occur in any future release.
Use of the feature is not recommended in production environments.
