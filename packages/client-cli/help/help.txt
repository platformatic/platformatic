Create a Fastify plugin that exposes a client for a remote OpenAPI or GraphQL API.

To create a client for a remote OpenAPI API, you can use the following command:

```bash
$ platformatic client http://example.com/to/schema/file -n myclient
```

To create a client for a remote Graphql API, you can use the following command:

```bash
$ platformatic client http://example.com/graphql -n myclient
```

Instead of a URL, you can also use a local file:

```bash
$ platformatic client path/to/schema -n myclient
```

This will create a Fastify plugin that exposes a client for the remote API in a folder `myclient`
and a file named myclient.js inside it.

If platformatic config file is specified, it will be edited and a `clients` section will be added.
Then, in any part of your Platformatic application you can use the client.

You can use the client in your application in Javascript, calling a GraphQL endpoint:

```js
module.exports = async function (app, opts) {
  app.post('/', async (request, reply) => {
    const res = await app.myclient.graphql({
      query: 'query { hello }'
    })
    return res
  })
}
```

or in Typescript, calling an OpenAPI endpoint:


```ts
import { FastifyInstance } from 'fastify'
/// <reference path="./myclient" />

export default async function (app: FastifyInstance) {
  app.get('/', async () => {
    return app.myclient.get({})
  })
}
```

Options:

* `-c, --config <path>` - Path to the configuration file.
* `-n, --name <name>` - Name of the client.
* `-f, --folder <name>` - Name of the plugin folder, defaults to --name value.
* `-t, --typescript` - Generate the client plugin in TypeScript.
* `-r, --full-response` - Client will return full response object rather than just the body.
