Closes a platformatic runtime application.

``` bash
  $ platformatic ctr close -n runtime-name
```

Options:

* `-p, --pid <number>` - The process id of the runtime to close.
* `-n, --name <string>` - The name of the runtime to close.

The `close` command stops all services of the runtime and kills the
runtime process. If you want to stop the runtime without killing the process
use the `platformatic ctr stop` command.

The `close` command uses the Platformatic Runtime Management API. To enable it
set the `managementApi` option to `true` in the runtime configuration file.

To get the list of runtimes with enabled management API use the
`platformatic ctr ps` command.
