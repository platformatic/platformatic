Starts all platformatic runtime services.

``` bash
  $ platformatic ctr start -n runtime-name
```

Options:

* `-p, --pid <number>` - The process id of the runtime to start.
* `-n, --name <string>` - The name of the runtime to start.

The `start` command uses the Platformatic Runtime Management API. To enable it
set the `managementApi` option to `true` in the runtime configuration file.

To get the list of runtimes with enabled management API use the
`platformatic ctr ps` command.
