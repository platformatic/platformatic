Stops a platformatic runtime application.

``` bash
  $ platformatic ctl stop -n runtime-name
```

Options:

* `-p, --pid <number>` - The process id of the runtime to stop.
* `-n, --name <string>` - The name of the runtime to stop.

The `stop` command uses the Platformatic Runtime Management API. To enable it
set the `managementApi` option to `true` in the runtime configuration file.

To get the list of runtimes with enabled management API use the
`platformatic ctl ps` command.
