Stops all platformatic runtime services.

``` bash
  $ platformatic ctl stop -n runtime-name
```

Options:

* `-p, --pid <number>` - The process id of the runtime to stop.
* `-n, --name <string>` - The name of the runtime to stop.

The `stop` command stops all services of the runtime, but does not kill the
runtime process itself. That means you still can work with the runtime via
`platformatic ctl` command.

To start the runtime again use the `platformatic ctl start` command. If you want
to completely remove the runtime use the `platformatic ctl close` command.

The `stop` command uses the Platformatic Runtime Management API. To enable it
set the `managementApi` option to `true` in the runtime configuration file.

To get the list of runtimes with enabled management API use the
`platformatic ctl ps` command.
