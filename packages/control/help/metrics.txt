Get metrics from the platformatic runtime application.

``` bash
  $ platformatic ctl metrics
```

Options:

* `-p, --pid <number>` - The process id of the runtime.
* `-f, --format <string>` - The format of the metrics, which should be either `text` or `json` (default to `json`).

If `--pid` is not specified, the command will get metrics from the first available matching runtime.

To see the list of all available control commands, run `platformatic ctl help`.
