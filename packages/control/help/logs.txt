Streams logs from the platformatic runtime application.

``` bash
  $ platformatic ctl logs -n runtime-name
```

Options:

* `-p, --pid <number>` - The process id of the runtime.
* `-n, --name <string>` - The name of the runtime.
* `-l, --level <string>` - The pino log level to stream. Default is `info`.
* `-s, --service <string>` - The name of the service to stream logs from.
* `--pretty <boolean>` - Pretty print the logs. Default is `true`.

If `--service` is not specified, the command will stream logs from all services.

The `logs` command uses the Platformatic Runtime Management API. To enable it
set the `managementApi` option to `true` in the runtime configuration file.

To get the list of runtimes with enabled management API use the
`platformatic ctl ps` command.
