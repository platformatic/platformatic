Start the Platformatic Service with the following command:

``` bash
 $ platformatic service start
 ```

You will need a  configuration file. Here is an example to get you started,
save the following as `platformatic.service.json`:

``` json
{
  "server": {
    "hostname": "127.0.0.1",
    "port": 0,
    "logger": {
      "level": "info"
    }
  },
  "plugin": {
    "path": "./plugin.js"
  }
}
```
