Compile typescript plugins.

``` bash
  $ platformatic service compile
```

As a result of executing this command, Platformatic Service will compile typescript
plugins in the `outDir` directory. 

Using the  `--clean` flag, the outDir directory will be removed before the new compilation process starts.

If not specified, the configuration will be loaded from any of the following, in the current directory.

* `platformatic.json`, or
* `platformatic.yml`, or 
* `platformatic.tml`

You can find more details about the configuration format here:
* [Platformatic Service Configuration](https://docs.platformatic.dev/docs/service/configuration)
