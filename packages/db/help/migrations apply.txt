Apply all configured migrations to the database:

``` bash
  $ platformatic db migrations apply
```

The migrations will be applied in the order they are specified in the
folder defined in the configuration file. If you want to apply a specific migration,
you can use the `--to` option:

``` bash
  $ platformatic db migrations apply --to 001
```

Here is an example migration:

``` sql
  CREATE TABLE graphs (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    name TEXT
  );
```

You can always rollback to a specific migration with:

``` bash
  $ platformatic db migrations apply --to VERSION
```

Use 000 to reset to the initial state.

Options:

* `-c, --config <path>` - Path to the configuration file.
* `-t, --to <version>` - Migrate to a specific version.

If not specified, the configuration will be loaded from any of the following, in the current directory.

* `platformatic.db.json`, or
* `platformatic.db.yml`, or 
* `platformatic.db.tml`

You can find more details about the configuration format here:
