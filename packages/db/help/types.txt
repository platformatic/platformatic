Generate typescript types for your entities from the database.

``` bash
  $ platformatic db types
```

As a result of executing this command, the Platformatic DB will generate a `types`
folder with a typescript file for each database entity. It will also generate a
`global.d.ts` file that injects the types into the Application instance.

In order to add type support to your plugins, you need to install some additional
dependencies. To do this, copy and run an `npm install` command with dependencies
that "platformatic db types" will ask you.

Here is an example of a platformatic plugin.js with jsdoc support.
You can use it to add autocomplete to your code.

``` javascript
/// <reference path="./global.d.ts" />
'use strict'

/** @param {import('fastify').FastifyInstance} app */
module.exports = async function (app) {
  app.get('/movie', async () => {
    const movies = await app.platformatic.entities.movie.find({
      where: { title: { eq: 'The Hitchhiker\'s Guide to the Galaxy' } }
    })
    return movies[0].id
  })
}
```

If not specified, the configuration will be loaded from any of the following, in the current directory.

* `platformatic.db.json`, or
* `platformatic.db.yml`, or 
* `platformatic.db.tml`

You can find more details about the configuration format here:
