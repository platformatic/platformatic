Start the Platformatic DB server with the following command:

``` bash
 $ platformatic db start
 ```

You will need a  configuration file. Here is an example to get you started,
save the following as `platformatic.db.json`:

``` json
  {
    "server": {
      "hostname": "127.0.0.1",
      "port": 0,
      "logger": {
        "level": "info"
      }
    },
    "db": {
      "connectionString": "sqlite://./db"
    },
    "migrations": {
      "dir": "./migrations"
    }
  }
```


Remember to create a migration, run the `db help migrate` command to know more.

All outstanding migrations will be applied to the database unless the
`migrations.autoApply` configuration option is set to false.

By sending the SIGUSR2 signal, the server can be reloaded.

Options:

  -c, --config FILE      Specify a configuration file to use

If not specified, the configuration specified will be loaded from `platformatic.db.json`,
`platformatic.db.yml`, or `platformatic.db.tml` in the current directory. You can find more details about
the configuration format at:
https://oss.platformatic.dev/docs/reference/db/configuration.
