Create frontend code to consume the REST APIs of a Platformatic application.

From the directory you want the frontend code to be generated (typically `<YOUR_FRONTEND_APP_DIRECTORY>/src/`) run -

```bash
npx platformatic frontend http://127.0.0.1:3042 ts
```

> :information_source:
>
> Where `http://127.0.0.1:3042` must be replaced with your Platformatic application endpoint, and the language can either be `ts` or `js`. When the command is run, the Platformatic CLI generates -
>
> * `api.d.ts` - A TypeScript module that includes all the OpenAPI-related types.
> * `api.ts` or `api.js` - A module that includes a function for every single REST endpoint.

Refer to the [dedicated guide](https://docs.platformatic.dev/docs/guides/generate-frontend-code-to-consume-platformatic-rest-api) where the full process of generating and consuming the frontend code is described.

In case of problems, please check that:

* The Platformatic app URL is valid.
* The Platformatic app whose URL belongs must be up and running.
* OpenAPI must be enabled (`db.openapi` in your `platformatic.db.json` is not set to `false`). You can find more details about the db configuration format [here](https://docs.platformatic.dev/docs/reference/db/configuration/#db).
* CORS must be managed in your Platformatic app (`server.cors.origin.regexp` in your `platformatic.db.json` is set to `/*/`, for instance). You can find more details about the cors configuration [here](https://docs.platformatic.dev/docs/reference/service/configuration/#server).
