Download Platformatic Runtime external services

``` bash
 $ platformatic download
```

Options:

* `-c, --config FILE` - Path to the runtime configuration file.
* `-u, --username string` - Username for the service repository.
* `-p, --password string` - Password for the service repository.

Platformatic download command downloads runtime services that have the `url` in their configuration.
By default services are cloned with `git` to the `external` directory inside the runtime directory.
To change the directory where a service is cloned, you can set the `path` property in the service configuration.

After cloning the service, the download command will set the relative path to the service in the runtime configuration file.

Example of the runtime platformatic.json configuration file:

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://schemas.platformatic.dev/@platformatic/runtime/2.0.0.json",
  "entrypoint": "service-1",
  "services": [
    {
      "id": "service-1",
      "path": "./services/service-1",
      "config": "platformatic.json"
    },
    {
      "id": "service-2",
      "config": "platformatic.json",
      "url": "https://github.com/test-owner/test-service.git"
    },
    {
      "id": "service-3",
      "config": "platformatic.json",
      "path": "./custom-external/service-3",
      "url": "https://github.com/test-owner/test-service.git"
    }
  ],
}
```
