# Introducing Watt 3: Faster, Simpler, and More Powerful Than Ever

Today, we're excited to announce the release of **Watt 3** (`wattpm` v3.0.0), a major evolution of the Platformatic platform that brings significant performance improvements, architectural simplifications, and modernization upgrades that will transform how you build and deploy Node.js applications.

## What's New in Watt 3

Watt 3 isn't just an incremental update‚Äîit's a complete reimagining of how Platformatic applications start, scale, and operate. With 18 commits and 15 major breaking changes, this release represents the most significant evolution in Platformatic's history. Here are the key transformations:

### üöÄ Parallel Application Startup and Shutdown

**The biggest performance boost yet.** Watt 3 now starts and stops all your applications in parallel instead of one-by-one. This means:

- **Faster deployments:** Complex applications with multiple services now start in a fraction of the time
- **Better resource utilization:** Your infrastructure resources are used more efficiently during startup
- **Enhanced reliability:** Improved error handling and dependency management during service lifecycle operations

Whether you're running a single service or orchestrating a complex microservice architecture, parallel execution dramatically reduces your time-to-ready.

```bash
# Before: Services started sequentially
Service A ‚Üí Service B ‚Üí Service C ‚Üí Gateway (45 seconds)

# After: Services started in parallel
Service A ‚îê
Service B ‚îú‚îÄ‚Üí All services ready! (12 seconds)
Service C ‚îò
```

### üíª Native TypeScript Support

**Direct TypeScript execution without compilation overhead.** Watt 3 removes the separate `@platformatic/ts-compiler` package and implements native TypeScript support:

- **No more build steps:** TypeScript files run directly using Node.js modern loaders
- **Faster development:** Eliminate intermediate compilation for quicker iterations
- **Simplified configuration:** Remove `typescript.outDir` and compilation flags
- **Better DX:** Native Node.js TypeScript support with zero configuration

Your TypeScript applications now run as smoothly as JavaScript, with no translation layers or build complexity.

### üèóÔ∏è Composer ‚Üí Gateway: A More Powerful API Gateway

**From simple composition to full-feattured gateway.** We've renamed the `composer` to `gateway` to better reflect its evolved capabilities:

- **Enhanced routing:** More sophisticated request routing and load balancing
- **Better proxy capabilities:** Improved upstream service integration
- **Cleaner architecture:** The name now matches the functionality

The transition is seamless with full backward compatibility, but the new gateway terminology better represents the powerful API gateway features you've been using.

### üß™ Modern Testing with Node.js Native Runner

**Goodbye external dependencies, hello native performance.** We've removed `borp` and embraced Node.js's built-in `--test` runner:

- **Fewer dependencies:** One less external testing framework to manage
- **Better performance:** Native Node.js testing is faster and more reliable
- **Future-proof:** Aligned with Node.js's testing roadmap and innovations

Your tests now run on the same engine that powers your applications‚Äîno translation layers, no extra overhead.

### üöÄ Massimo: From Integrated Tool to Standalone Powerhouse

**Great news for API client generation!** What began as `@platformatic/client` has evolved into something much bigger. We've extracted and enhanced it as **[Massimo](https://massimohttp.dev/)**‚Äîa production-proven, standalone client generation solution:

- **Enhanced capabilities:** Dual architecture with both runtime library and code generator
- **Production proven:** Already powering companies like Spendesk in production
- **Zero dependencies:** Frontend clients with no external dependencies
- **Better performance:** Optimized for both server-side (Undici) and browser (fetch) environments
- **Active development:** Dedicated project with community contributions

This extraction allows Massimo to evolve independently while Watt 3 focuses on its core application platform strengths.

### üßπ Streamlined Architecture  

**Simpler is better.** With Massimo now independent, we've streamlined Watt 3 by removing the integrated client generation:

- **Reduce complexity:** 25,000+ lines of code removed for a leaner, more focused platform
- **Improve maintainability:** Fewer moving parts means more reliable core functionality  
- **Clear separation:** Client generation and application platform concerns properly separated

This change creates a cleaner architecture where each tool excels in its domain‚ÄîWatt 3 for application platforms, Massimo for API clients.

### üè∑Ô∏è Clearer Terminology: From Stackables to Capabilities

**Better names for better understanding.** We've renamed "stackables" to "capabilities" throughout the platform, along with a complete architectural overhaul:

- **Intuitive naming:** "Capabilities" better describes what these components do
- **Consistent terminology:** Unified language across docs, APIs, and code
- **Developer clarity:** Easier onboarding and understanding for new users
- **Modern architecture:** New `applicationFactory` pattern with cleaner separation of concerns
- **Modular exports:** Structured exports for better composability and testing

The new capability format provides a much cleaner development experience with better separation between configuration, transformation, and application logic.

### üì± Services Become Applications

**Broader scope, better naming.** The platform now uses "applications" instead of "services":

- **Accurate representation:** Reflects the full range of what you can deploy
- **Modern terminology:** Aligns with current cloud-native conventions
- **Backward compatibility:** Existing configurations continue to work during migration

### ‚ö° Unified CLI Experience

**One CLI to rule them all.** We've consolidated individual CLIs (`plt-service`, `plt-composer`, `plt-db`) into the unified `wattpm` CLI:

- **Simplified workflows:** Single command interface for all operations
- **Reduced complexity:** Fewer tools to learn and manage
- **Consistent experience:** Same patterns across different application types
- **11,000+ lines removed:** Massive cleanup and simplification

### üèóÔ∏è Architectural Modernization

**Foundation for the future.** Major architectural improvements include:

- **ESM everywhere:** Complete migration from CommonJS to ES modules
- **Node.js 22+ required:** Leverage latest performance improvements and features
- **Unified base classes:** All capabilities now inherit from `BaseStackable`
- **Package restructuring:** Split utilities for better modularity (`@platformatic/wattpm-utils`)

### üßπ Feature Cleanup

**Focus on what matters.** We've removed underutilized features to improve maintainability:

- **Marketplace removal:** Use standard package managers instead
- **Log rolling removal:** External log rotation for better ops practices
- **Control CLI removal:** Integrated into main CLI for consistency
- **25,000+ lines removed:** Leaner, more focused codebase

## Why These Changes Matter

  }
}
```

### 6. Update Import Statements and Capability Format
```javascript
// Update ESM imports
-const { service } = require('@platformatic/service')
+import { application } from '@platformatic/service'

// Update capability references
-import { stackable } from './stackable.js'
+import { capability } from './capability.js'

// Migrate custom capabilities to new format
// Before (old stackable format)
-export async function stackable(fastify, opts) {
-  await fastify.register(plugin, opts)
-}
-stackable.Generator = Generator
-stackable.configType = 'my-capability'

// After (new capability format)
+export async function myCapability(app, stackable) {
+  await platformaticService(app, stackable)
+  await app.register(plugin, stackable)
+}
+
+export async function create(configOrRoot, sourceOrConfig, context) {
+  return createService(configOrRoot, sourceOrConfig, { 
+    schema, 
+    applicationFactory: myCapability, 
+    transform, 
+    ...context 
+  })
+}
+
+export { Generator } from './generator.js'
